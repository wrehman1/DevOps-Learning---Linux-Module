# DevOps-Learning---Linux-Module
so far, I have learnt basic commands that unlock a whole new level of understanding about how systems operate:

• pwd — Shows me the current directory I’m in (“print working directory”)
• ls — Lists the files and folders in my current location
• cd — Allows me to move between directories (“change directory”)
• touch filename.txt — Creates a new empty file
• mkdir foldername — Creates a new directory
• sudo apt update — Updates package lists (critical for system security and software installs!)

I have played the over the wire bandit game which is a Linix based wargame that has an awesome way of sharpening my command-like skills. 
Each level forces you to think critcally, explore system behaviour, and get hands on with tools like ssh, grep, find, cat, chmod, and more.
I accomplished up to level 16 of this game.
